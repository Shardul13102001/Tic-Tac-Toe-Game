# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Introduction
This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Java. The game allows two players to take turns and place their marks (X or O) on a 3x3 board until one of them wins or the game results in a draw.

## Features
- Two-player turn-based gameplay
- Input validation to ensure valid moves
- Win conditions based on rows, columns, and diagonals
- Displays the board after each move

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Copy the code into a file named `LaunchGame.java`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
4. Compile the program using the following command:
   ```sh
   javac LaunchGame.java
   ```
5. Run the program using:
   ```sh
   java LaunchGame
   ```

## How to Play
1. The game starts with Player 1 (X) and Player 2 (O).
2. Players are prompted to enter the row and column numbers (0-2) to place their marks.
3. The game board updates after each move.
4. A player wins if they get three marks in a row, column, or diagonal.
5. If all spots are filled and no player wins, the game ends in a draw.

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for playing against a computer (AI opponent)
